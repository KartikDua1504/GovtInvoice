### PPT Medical Invoice DApp – Empowering Healthcare on Optimism 

PPT Utility Token Deployment in Medical Invoice DApp

We have deployed the PPT utility token on the Optimism (OP) Mainnet to power key functions within our Medical Invoice DApp: 

✅ Save: Securely save medical invoices on-chain using PPT tokens, ensuring data integrity and long-term availability.

✅ Save As: Create multiple versions of invoices for different stakeholders while maintaining data consistency.

✅ Print: Generate and print invoices securely, ensuring authenticity and alignment with on-chain records.

#### Impact

By leveraging Optimism's low-cost and high-speed transaction capabilities, the DApp reduces administrative costs, enhances transparency, and empowers patients with control over their medical data.
